# DiscordBotPython

The purpose of this repository is mainly for upload my bots translated into Python since is a much more efficient language for these tasks, and also way lighter.
As you guys probably have seen, most of my code currently is private since the users that are using those bots wanted it like that, but most of the basics functionality and how it works would be uploaded here.
Expect mistakes since im still learning and reading the documentation :P
